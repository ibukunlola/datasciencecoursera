Hello! I am Ibukunoluwa Aribilola, a rising Junior and data science major at Minerva Schools at KGI. I have created this repository for my final project in data science course I'm taking with Coursera: The Data Scientist's Toolbox.
If you ever want to chat about education â€“ specifically teaching and curriculum development, travelling, economics, food, and Netflix shows & movies, shoot me an email at ibukunaribilola@gmail.com. I'd love to get to know you too!
